ECE16
I am eager to enroll in UCSD's ECE 16, because it offers a comprehensive introduction to embedded systems, focusing on the integration of hardware and software to interact with real-world signals. The course's emphasis on programming microcontrollers using C and analyzing data with Python aligns perfectly with my goal to develop practical skills in embedded systems design. Additionally, the structured lab assignments, culminating in a final design competition, provide a hands-on experience that will enhance my understanding of sampling, signal processing, communication, and real-time control.
Regarding the Arduino code provided earlier, In the setup() function, the built-in LED pin is initialized as an output using pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);. The loop() function then repeatedly turns the LED on with digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);, waits for 1 second (delay(1000);), turns the LED off with digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);, and waits for 0.5 seconds (delay(500);). This sequence creates a blinking pattern where the LED is on for 1 second and off for 0.5 seconds, continuously repeating.
